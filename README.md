* I want to be able to delete users
* I want to be able to buy resources with my money.
* I want to be able to log in and have it remember me.
* I want to be able to increment my resources.
* I want to be able to increment my resources.
* I want to be able to log in and have it remember me.
* I want to know what my bottleneck resource is.
* I want to be able to click on a resource and have it display a blurb.
* I want to be able to pick the disaster I suffer.
* I want to see how long I would survive in a particular disaster.
* I want to be able to see the high scores.
